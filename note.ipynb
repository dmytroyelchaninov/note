    "Nice, it works. But I can create several Cache instances, which can mess up everything.\n",

    "I should mention that it's not only about cache, e.g. you can control over number of connections, requests and other stuff. There are a lot of examples where you need only one class instance! You might need to store some settings which should be stored only once and be accessible from any place.\n",

This method executed by default firstly any time you call (create) any object. You can't control over memory it uses like in C++, but *you can control* the process of the object \"construction\".\n",
